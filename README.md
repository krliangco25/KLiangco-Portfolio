# Prediction-and-Machine-Learning

Good Day! 

This is Karizza Liangco's repository, the codes were done for the completion of our subject COE 005 - Prediction and Machine Learning.
Other codes are done for studying purposes to upskill. 

The datasets that were utilized for the completion of the codes are usually researched in Kaggle, or was given to us by our good professor. 

Thank you.
